TO-DO:
- header section button hovers
- the windows vintage stuff ruined some of the other UI (X button on the stamp card, left/right buttons in popups)
- experiences button doesnt work
- fonts not working anymore
- also make projects section less sparse (maybe display all projects instead of having left/right buttons, and remove the left/right)
- make sure popup height/width is never larger than the screen, user shouldnt need to scroll in a popup
- echoai image not there
- add a short footer
-maybe put experineces before projects? idk depends how it looks

INSPO:
- ciaragan.com - i esp like her header section, i like how all the pics/elements kinda get subtly bigger and smaller, i also like the features section on her exhibits page, i want to recreate that w a code backgorund for my coding projects, also i like the stamp vibe on her about page maybe ill recreate that for my awards?
- den.cool -  i like the 3d elemenets and balloons and how they r interactive
