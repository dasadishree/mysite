my personal website!

PLANNING:
popup icons: hackclub, running/track related thing, techfluences logo, thli, art/creative thing, research thing, google codenext, family/friends, and lots of cute emojis

TO-DO:
- navbar: links to reacvh section, icons to connect to me (email, linkiedin, jithub, resume)
- 1st section: welcome to my corner - when u click on my picture it should shoot out other pictures including hack club, 
- projects section: like a cool cyberpunk/techy code backgorund and then each projects smylbol coming out
- experiences section: hackathons, summer programs etc
- cool interactive backgtorund would be nice, make elements slightly move so tyhat it seems more interacrtve
-2nd section:
the moving text that fills in diff words like "hackathon organzier" "creative coder" "researcher" "highschooler" "woman in STEM" "tech for social good enthusiast" etc (like my old website had). maybe put stamps for awards on this section and my description


inspo: 
- ciaragan.com - i esp like her header section, i like how all the pics/elements kinda get subtly bigger and smaller, i also like the features section on her exhibits page, i want to recreate that w a code backgorund for my coding projects, also i like the stamp vibe on her about page maybe ill recreate that for my awards?
- den.cool -  i like the 3d elemenets and balloons and how they r interactive
